        <h1>Measure 110</h1>
        <p>In an attempt to relieve the rampant drug use issue, Portland officials proposed a new law named "Measure 110" back in February 2021. This law tried to mimic similar ideas that have been successfully implemented in several European countries. Measure 110 aimed to lower arrests and encourage Portland drug users to seek help by decriminalizing the possession of narcotics. However, due to poor planning and questionable decisions, Portland failed to implement Measure 110 effectively. It is now your job as the new Mayor of Portland to make the right choices and enact Measure 110!</p>
